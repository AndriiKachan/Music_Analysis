# Music_Analysis (Preprocessing and EDA)

# üåø Background
I was looking to better to understand how music features affect views, likes, comments and streaming, who are top-10 artists by these 4 parameters and their distributions. I felt the best way to start was to use a dataset from Kaggle.

[Check out this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salvatorerastelli/spotify-and-youtube/data)

# üìã Dataset

The dataset contains the following 26 columns:

* **Track**: Name of the song on Spotify.

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** (Analyze the data to uncover patterns and relationships between variables)
* **Data Modeling:** (Apply models to analyze relationships and predict outcomes based on the data)
* **Data Visualization and Reporting:** (Create visualizations and reports to clearly communicate analysis findings)
